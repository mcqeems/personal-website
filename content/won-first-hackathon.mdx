Moments after being announced as the winner of my first hackathon, it truly felt like a dream. In that instant, I realized the scale of my capabilities and how much I've improved. It wasn't just a hopeful dream anymore, it was real, a tangible fact.

## Why This Victory Matters So Much

This hackathon has become a pivotal stepping stone for me in the tech world. It taught me invaluable lessons in web development and, most excitingly, in Artificial Intelligence. You might ask, "Why AI?" Well, the entire event was centered around the theme of integrating AI to solve real-world problems. And the application I developed aims to do just that—tackle a significant societal issue. Whether it truly solves the problem is something we'll see in time, but this is a powerful start.

I am profoundly grateful for this victory; all the hard work has finally paid off. I have always prayed to God that my actions and work would be meaningful, serving as proof of my dedication for the days to come. This is my first major stepping stone, and I know I'm not done yet. This is just the beginning.

## The Hackathon: Dicoding's "elevAite"

The competition was a national hackathon held by Dicoding in collaboration with Microsoft, called **elevAite**. It was the culminating event of their main training agenda, which provides a learning path for AI, followed by the hackathon and a global certification from Microsoft. On a side note, I actually failed my global certification exam due to some circumstances I'd rather not get into it's a bit embarrassing! But in the end, I feel like I won the real game, and that’s what counts.

## The Project: "Renaissance"

I developed a web application called **[Renaissance](https://renaissance.qeem.site)**. The core idea was born from observing the widespread problem of online gambling addiction in Indonesia, where many individuals waste their lives on something that ultimately becomes a destructive boomerang. Renaissance aims to be the solution, a platform for a new beginning.

It is built around three main features:

- **Curhat Journal:** "Curhat" is a popular Indonesian slang term for venting or confiding. This feature acts as a private, digital friend where you can share your inner thoughts and document your daily journey without judgment.

- **Chat Rena:** This is a chatbot designed to understand you on a human level. Named Rena after the app itself _"Renaissance"_, she acts as your best pal in any situation. She's programmed to be empathetic, not just a robot disguised as a person. (Fair warning: she can get quite scary if you make her mad ☠️).

- **Mental Check:** This feature helps you quickly reflect on your mental condition without needing an immediate doctor's appointment. By answering 30 questions—guaranteed to be similar to those asked by therapists you can get a snapshot of your mental state. However, it's crucial to remember that this **does not replace a professional psychologist**. It's a first step, a recommendation for short-term insight. For long-term help, professional consultation is always the right path.

These are just the highlights. I invite you to explore the application for yourself!

## The Journey Through the Hackathon

The hackathon was held entirely online. For many, the long duration and freedom might seem like an advantage, but for me, it was a different story. It was a nightmare of self-discipline, constantly needing to stay on track and ensure my project perfectly matched the topic. And the competition was intimidating some of my opponents were senior programmers. I'm talking about a developer with a Master's degree from Tokyo and a lecturer from one of Indonesia's finest universities. And you know what? I beat them. Not because my project was technically better, but because theirs didn't align with the hackathon's theme. I consider myself incredibly lucky.

## The Technology Behind Renaissance

For those interested in the technical details, Renaissance was built on a modern web stack, leveraging the power of AI to bring its features to life:

- **Frontend:** React Router with Tailwind CSS to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend:** A Node.js server with Express.js to efficiently handle user data and requests.
- **AI & Machine Learning:** The heart of Chat Rena is powered by **Microsoft Azure AI Services**, a key part of the hackathon's theme. I utilized their language understanding models to generate human-like, empathetic conversations.
- **Database:** Firestore from Firebase was used to securely store journal entries and user progress, ensuring privacy and data integrity.

## What's Next? The Road Ahead

As I said, this is just the beginning. Winning the elevAite hackathon has given me the validation and motivation to take Renaissance to the next level. My immediate plan is to gather user feedback to refine the existing features and make Chat Rena even more intelligent and helpful.

In the long term, I envision Renaissance evolving into a full-fledged community platform—a safe space where users can not only track their own journey but also anonymously connect with and support others facing similar struggles. This win wasn't the finish line; it was the firing of the starting pistol.

To close, I want to express my deepest gratitude once again. To God, for giving me the strength and the idea. To Dicoding and Microsoft, for creating an incredible opportunity like elevAite. And to everyone who has supported me along the way. If you are a developer hesitating to join a hackathon or start that project you believe in, let this be your sign. Just start. You are far more capable than you realize.

My journey is just getting started, and I entrust the road ahead to God's plan. Thank you for reading.
